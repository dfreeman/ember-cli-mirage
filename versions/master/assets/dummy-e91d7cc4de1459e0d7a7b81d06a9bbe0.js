If the user specifies that an author has many books, I decided that an author should simply get a "],[7,"code"],[9],[0,"bookIds: []"],[10],[0," array to manage the foreign keys — and nothing more.

Instead, create a trait that has meaning within your domain - say, a published post - to simplify the data setup needed to write each of your comment tests.
